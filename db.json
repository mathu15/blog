      "description": "When Bitcoin was first invented, many hailed it as the solution to inefficient cross-border remittances. But because of the high fees associated with transactions on the BTC Core network, it has never been able to live up to its full potential.That’s why Kumaraguru Ramanujam has chosen to build on the Bitcoin SV blockchain instead. His application, MoneySwipe, aims to bring down fees for sending money abroad from the current global average of 7% to just 1.5%.",

      "title": "Better payments with BSV",
      "description": "MoneySwipe’s target is a bit different. Ramanujam tells the audience that he wants to change the remittance landscape, especially in his homeland of India, the world’s largest remittance destination. Last year, the country, which is home to 17% of the world’s population, received $87 billion in remittances, but the fees to the consumers are still way too high.The panelists noted that with Bitcoin SV’s massive scaling, very low fees, and real-time transactions, a new world of opportunities and business models has opened up. With micropayments, for instance, pay-per-use becomes a real possibility. And as Ramanujam pointed out, Bitcoin SV can also be used as a backend network on which stablecoins, which are regulatory compliant, are issued and settled.Best in class With all the developments in Bitcoin payments,consumers are spoilt for choice and sometimes can be overwhelmed. Centi’s Müller believes it may be about time for BSV payments to be standardized. This would allow the different platforms to inter-transact and offer customers more choice and diversity. Centi users who want to send remittances to India could do so directly through MoneySwipe and pay for their groceries through Centbee while enjoying Haste Arcade through HandCash.There’s a caveat, however.",
